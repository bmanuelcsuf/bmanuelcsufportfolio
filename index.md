### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Since lab 1 was my first time coding, that is why I like it. I had never before had to write code using VS code or a terminal. The current style of coding is more beneficial than my old high school one.

* Lab 2

Because Lab 2 was similar to a project I completed in high school, I felt a connection to it. Despite being a learning leap from Lab 1's header creation, it was nonetheless a good assingment to allow me to get commfortable with the way we code.


* Lab 3


Although Lab 3 was quite challenging but I enjoyed it. Me and my partner struggled during the process of how to structure the code. Luckily our notes allowed us complete it.
